 static attributes exist beyond a particular instance of a class, 
 but do not extend into conflict with other static attributes defined within other classes.

Using constexpr instead of const
static float constexpr pi_{3.14159};


Just like static member variables, static member functions are instance-independent: 
they belong to the class, not to any particular instance of the class.
One corollary to this is that we can method invoke a static member function without ever creating an instance of the class.
