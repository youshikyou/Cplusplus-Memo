Since C++11, there is a new type available called rvalue reference, which can be identified from the double ampersand && after a type name.
With this operator, it is possible to store and even modify an rvalue, i.e. a temporary object which would otherwise be lost quickly.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int i = 1; 
    int j = 2; 
    int k = i + j; 
    int &&l = i + j; 

    std::cout << "k = " << k << ", l = " << l << std::endl;

    return 0; 
}
