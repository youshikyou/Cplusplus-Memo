No copying policy
The simplest policy of all is to forbid copying and assigning class instances all together. 
This can be achieved by declaring, but not defining a private copy constructor and assignment operator (see NoCopyClass1 below) or alternatively 
by making both public and assigning the delete operator (see NoCopyClass2 below).
The second choice is more explicit and makes it clearer to the programmer that copying has been actively forbidden. 
Let us have a look at a code example on the right that illustrates both cases.

Exclusive ownership policy
This policy states that whenever a resource management object is copied, 
the resource handle is transferred from the source pointer to the destination pointer. 
In the process, the source pointer is set to nullptr to make ownership exclusive. 
At any time, the resource handle belongs only to a single object, which is responsible for its deletion when it is no longer needed.
One problem in this implementation is that for a short time there are effectively 
two valid handles to the same resource - after the handle has been copied and before it is set to nullptr.
In concurrent programs, this would cause a data race for the resource. A much better alternative to handle exclusive ownership in C++ would be to use move semantics,

/*
Deep copy policy
With this policy, copying and assigning class instances to each other is possible without the danger of resource conflicts. 
The idea is to allocate proprietary memory in the destination object and 
then to copy the content to which the source object handle is pointing into the newly allocated block of memory.
This way, the content is preserved during copy or assignment. 
However, this approach increases the memory demands and the uniqueness of the data is lost: 
After the deep copy has been made, two versions of the same resource exist in memory

/*
Shared ownership policy
The last ownership policy we will be discussing in this course implements a shared ownership behavior.
The idea is to perform a copy or assignment similar to the default behavior, 
i.e. copying the handle instead of the content (as with a shallow copy) while at the same time keeping track of the number of instances that also point to 
the same resource. Each time an instance goes out of scope, the counter is decremented.
Once the last object is about to be deleted, it can safely deallocate the memory resource. 
We will see later in this course that this is the central idea of unique_ptr, which is a representative of the group of smart pointers.

In the first example we have seen that the default implementation of the copy constructor does not consider the "special" needs of a class 
which allocates and deallocates a shared resource on the heap. 
The problem with implicitly using the default copy constructor or assignment operator is that programmers are not forced to consider the implications for the memory management
policy of their program. In the case of the first example, this leads to a segmentation fault and thus a program crash.

In order to properly manage memory allocation, deallocation and copying behavior, we have seen that there is an intricate relationship between destructor, 
copy constructor and copy assignment operator. 
To this end, the Rule of Three states that if a class needs to have an overloaded copy constructor, copy assignment operator, ~or~ destructor,
then it must also implement the other two as well to ensure that memory is managed consistently. As we have seen, the copy constructor and copy assignment operator 
(which are often almost identical) control how the resource gets copied between objects while the destructor manages the resource deletion.

You may have noted that in the previous code example, the class SharedCopy does not implement the assignment operator. This is a violation of the Rule of Three and thus,
if we were to use something like destination3 = source instead of SharedCopy destination3(source), the counter variable would not be properly decremented.
